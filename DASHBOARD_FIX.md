# Dashboard Stats Fix

## Problem
The dashboard page was throwing a runtime error: `stats.map is not a function` at line 199 in `src/app/page.tsx`.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a mismatch between the data structure and how it was being used:

1. **Interface Definition**: `DashboardStats` was defined as an object with properties like `totalRevenue`, `inventoryValue`, `activeCustomers`, and `pendingOrders`.

2. **Usage**: The code was trying to use `stats.map()` which expects `stats` to be an array.

3. **Data Flow**: The fallback data was correctly defined as an array, but when `dashboardData?.stats` was available, it was an object, not an array.

## Solution
The fix involved converting the `DashboardStats` object into an array format that could be used with the `.map()` method.

### Changes Made
**File**: `/src/app/page.tsx`

**Original Code**:
```typescript
const stats = dashboardData?.stats || [
  { 
    nameKey: 'dashboard.totalRevenue', 
    value: 'R 0.00', 
    change: '+0.0%', 
    changeType: 'positive' as const,
    details: 'No data available',
    icon: 'ðŸ’°',
    href: '/accounting',
    color: 'bg-green-50 border-green-200'
  },
  // ... other stats
]
```

**Fixed Code**:
```typescript
const stats = dashboardData?.stats ? [
  { ...dashboardData.stats.totalRevenue, nameKey: 'dashboard.totalRevenue' },
  { ...dashboardData.stats.inventoryValue, nameKey: 'dashboard.inventoryValue' },
  { ...dashboardData.stats.activeCustomers, nameKey: 'dashboard.activeCustomers' },
  { ...dashboardData.stats.pendingOrders, nameKey: 'dashboard.pendingOrders' }
] : [
  { 
    nameKey: 'dashboard.totalRevenue', 
    value: 'R 0.00', 
    change: '+0.0%', 
    changeType: 'positive' as const,
    details: 'No data available',
    icon: 'ðŸ’°',
    href: '/accounting',
    color: 'bg-green-50 border-green-200'
  },
  // ... other stats
]
```

### Key Changes
1. **Conditional Logic**: Added a conditional check to determine if `dashboardData?.stats` exists
2. **Object-to-Array Conversion**: When `dashboardData?.stats` exists, convert it from an object to an array
3. **Property Preservation**: Use the spread operator (`...`) to preserve all existing properties of each stat object
4. **NameKey Addition**: Add the `nameKey` property to each stat object for consistent usage

## Testing
- âœ… ESLint passes with no errors
- âœ… Page compiles successfully
- âœ… No runtime errors in browser console
- âœ… Dashboard loads and displays stats correctly
- âœ… Navigation from stats cards works properly

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
1. The dashboard page loads without runtime errors
2. Stats are displayed correctly whether using real data or fallback data
3. All existing functionality remains intact
4. The code is more robust and handles different data scenarios

## Future Considerations
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Consider standardizing the data structure (either always use objects or always use arrays)
2. Add TypeScript validation to ensure data types match expected formats
3. Add unit tests to catch such issues early in development
4. Consider using a more robust data fetching library with built-in type checking
