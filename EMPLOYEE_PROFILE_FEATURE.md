# Employee Profile Management Feature

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a comprehensive Employee Profile Management system designed for HR administrators to manage employee information, documents, and employment details.

## Business Logic
The system follows a business process where:
1. Employees register with basic information (simple signup process)
2. HR administrators (with appropriate permissions) fill in detailed employee information
3. Employees can view their profiles to ensure the company has correct details
4. HR managers are typically given admin access to manage employee profiles

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Employee Profile Data Structure
The profile system now includes comprehensive employee information:

**Personal Information:**
- Basic details (name, email, phone, address)
- ID number and emergency contact information
- Bio and personal notes

**Employment Information:**
- Position, department, start date
- Employment type (permanent, contract, temporary, internship)
- Salary information and manager assignment
- Driver's license and tax number

**Banking Information:**
- Bank name, account number, and branch details

**Document Management:**
- ID document upload and storage
- Driver's license upload and storage
- Other licenses and certifications management
- Employment contract and other document storage

### 2. User Interface Improvements

#### Tabbed Interface
The profile page is organized into four main sections:
- **Personal Info**: Basic personal and contact information
- **Employment**: Job-related details and employment information
- **Documents**: Document uploads and management
- **Banking**: Financial and banking information

#### HR-Focused Design
- Updated page title to "Employee Profile Management"
- Changed description to reflect HR management functionality
- Updated badges and icons to show employment type and status
- Added HR-specific fields like ID number, manager name, etc.

#### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with responsive layouts
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Proper spacing and alignment across all screen sizes

### 3. API Enhancements

#### Extended Data Structure
The API now supports the complete employee profile data structure with all HR-related fields.

#### Mock Data
Comprehensive mock data includes:
- South African ID number format
- Realistic salary information (ZAR)
- Sample documents and licenses
- Emergency contact details
- Banking information

### 4. Key Components

#### Profile Card
- Displays employee photo, name, position, and department
- Shows employment status and type badges
- Includes key information like ID number, manager, and start date

#### Edit Functionality
- Toggle between view and edit modes
- Form validation and proper input types
- Save and cancel operations with proper feedback

#### Document Upload
- Placeholder for ID document and driver's license uploads
- Support for additional licenses and certifications
- Document list with upload dates and view functionality

## Technical Notes

### Dependencies
- No additional dependencies were required
- Uses existing shadcn/ui components
- Leverages Next.js 15 and TypeScript 5

### Database Considerations
- Current implementation uses mock data
- Prisma schema will need to be updated to support new fields
- Database migration will be required when implementing real storage

### Security Considerations
- Sensitive information (banking, ID numbers) should be encrypted
- Role-based access control should be implemented
- Document uploads need proper validation and security

## Conclusion

The Employee Profile Management feature provides a solid foundation for HR administrators to manage comprehensive employee information. The system is designed with scalability and extensibility in mind, allowing for easy integration with additional HR modules and real database storage when ready.

The implementation follows modern React/Next.js best practices and provides a user-friendly interface that works well across all device types. The tabbed organization makes it easy for HR staff to navigate through different categories of employee information efficiently.
