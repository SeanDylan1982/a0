# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes a comprehensive global activity tracking and data sharing system for Account Zero. The system ensures all user actions are logged, inventory movements are centrally managed, data is shared across modules based on role hierarchy, and real-time notifications keep users informed of relevant activities. This is a foundational system that affects every module and ensures data consistency, audit trails, and proper role-based access control across the entire platform.

6. WHEN sales are processed THEN the system SHALL deduct stock from the central pool and log the movement

### Requirement 3: Cross-Module Data Sharing
