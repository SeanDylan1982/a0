# Product Selector Modal Display Fix - Requirements

## Introduction

The product selector modal in the invoicing system is not displaying properly, with the "Add Product" button being cut off and the table content overflowing horizontally. This affects the user experience when creating quotes and invoices, making it difficult to add products to documents.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Modal Width and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a user creating invoices or quotes, I want the product selector modal to display at an appropriate width so that I can see all table columns and action buttons clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the product selector modal THEN the modal SHALL occupy 85% of the viewport width on desktop screens
2. WHEN the viewport width is less than 768px THEN the modal SHALL occupy 95% of the viewport width
3. WHEN the modal is displayed THEN all table columns SHALL be visible without horizontal scrolling
4. WHEN the modal content exceeds the available height THEN vertical scrolling SHALL be enabled while maintaining the modal structure

### Requirement 2: Table Layout and Action Button Visibility

**User Story:** As a user browsing products in the modal, I want to see all product information and be able to click the "Add Product" button for each item.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the product table is displayed THEN the "Add Product" button SHALL be fully visible and clickable for each product row
2. WHEN the table content is wider than the modal THEN horizontal scrolling SHALL be available within the table container
3. WHEN a user hovers over the "Add Product" button THEN the tooltip SHALL display correctly
4. WHEN the table has many columns THEN the Action column SHALL remain sticky on the right side for easy access

### Requirement 3: Cross-Browser Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user accessing the system from different browsers, I want the modal to display consistently across all modern browsers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modal is opened in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge THEN the display SHALL be consistent
2. WHEN the browser has scrollbars THEN the modal width calculation SHALL account for scrollbar width
3. WHEN the user zooms in or out THEN the modal SHALL maintain proper proportions and usability

### Requirement 4: Performance and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user working with large product catalogs, I want the modal to load quickly and remain responsive during interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modal opens THEN it SHALL render within 200ms
2. WHEN scrolling through products THEN the interface SHALL remain responsive
3. WHEN adding products THEN the modal SHALL not close unexpectedly
4. WHEN the modal is open THEN keyboard navigation SHALL work properly (Tab, Escape, Enter)

### Requirement 5: Fallback Solutions

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want multiple fallback approaches available if the primary solution doesn't work across all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF viewport-based sizing fails THEN a fixed pixel-based approach SHALL be used as fallback
2. IF table overflow issues persist THEN a card-based layout SHALL be available as an alternative
3. IF modal constraints cannot be resolved THEN a full-screen overlay approach SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN any fallback is activated THEN the user experience SHALL remain intuitive and functional

### Requirement 6: Mobile and Tablet Support

**User Story:** As a user accessing the system on mobile or tablet devices, I want the product selector to be usable on smaller screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessed on mobile devices THEN the modal SHALL use a full-screen approach
2. WHEN accessed on tablets THEN the modal SHALL adapt to the available screen space
3. WHEN using touch interfaces THEN all buttons SHALL be appropriately sized for touch interaction
4. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN the modal SHALL adapt accordingly

### Requirement 7: Accessibility Compliance

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the modal to be fully accessible via keyboard and screen readers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be reachable via Tab key
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN all content SHALL be properly announced
3. WHEN the modal opens THEN focus SHALL be trapped within the modal
4. WHEN the modal closes THEN focus SHALL return to the triggering element
